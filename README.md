LangGraph Agent with Tools

This project demonstrates how to build an agentic workflow using LangGraph LangChain community tools and an LLM bound with external APIs.

The agent can:

  Query Wikipedia for factual information.

  Query Arxiv for research papers.

  Use custom tools (e.g., Tavily).

  Process user queries through a graph-based workflow.

üöÄ Features

  Wikipedia Search via WikipediaQueryRun.

  Arxiv Search via ArxivQueryRun.

  Custom Tool Support (e.g., Tavily).

  LangGraph-based Workflow with tool nodes and conditional branching.

  Visualization of the graph using Mermaid.


‚öôÔ∏è Installation

  1. Clone the repository
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/langgraph-agent-with-tools.git
     cd langgraph-agent-with-tools


  2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
     uv venv
     source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
     venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
     
  3. Install dependencies
     uv pip install -r requirements.txt
     or uv sync
     
üîÆ Future Improvements:
      Add more domain-specific tools (e.g., weather, finance, news).
      Integrate memory into the workflow.
      Extend graph visualization for debugging agent workflows.
